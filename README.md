This project is based on MERN stack web application which is used for selling organic soils , made organic soils, and also used to track them... This unique project was assigned by <b>UNIFIED MENTOR</b> team during my internship.

<h1 align="center">Soil Farming</h1>
<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A dynamic website for displaying the available organic products at <b>Soil Farms</b>, a admin dashboard that displays the sales and customer data of <b>Soil Farms</b>. Also provides multiple API's for other similar businesses to interact with <b>Soil Farms</b>. 
<br>
<b>Soil Farms</b> is developed using a MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This stack delivers an exceptional user experience, robust backend functionality, and efficient data storage and retrieval capabilities.

## Made with

| Tech used               | For        |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| HTML + CSS + JavaScript | Frontend   |

## The Pages:

1) Admin Dashboard
2) Admin Panel
- The admin panel view is meant to handle all the orders, products, and registered users
- An order can be marked as delivered, after the user has completed the payment
- The admin can create a product for the shop, which makes it easier to add/remove more products to replicate a real world e-commerce site
- The users detail can altered, only by setting them as admin or not. Other than this, the admin cannot change any other detail about the registered user.
- Helps give an estimate of the total number of orders and users on the app.

## Technology Stack

The MERN Stack is a popular full-stack development solution that combines MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These components seamlessly work together to create robust web applications.

## MERN Stack Components:

*MongoDB:* A flexible NoSQL database for storing data in JSON-like documents. It excels in performance, availability, and scalability, making it ideal for handling large volumes of data and complex queries.

*Express.js:* A minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies building web APIs and handling HTTP requests, providing robust features and middleware for web and mobile applications.

*React.js:* A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially Single Page Applications (SPAs). Its component-based architecture enables code reusability and maintainability.

*Node.js:* A JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution. It focuses on performance, making it perfect for scalable and efficient back-end development.
